# Udacity project - Web App with Azure Functions and Flask Webapp Front-end

This project is part of Udacity Cloud Developer on Azure Nanodegree. It summarizes the third module dedicated to Azure Microservices. In this module, we cover Serverless functions (FunctionApps, WebApps,...), Logic Apps and Event Grid / Hub as well as Deployment (serverless, containerization with Docker and deployment to Kubernetes) and security features with lots of hand-on practice.

The purpose of the project is to deploy a Flask web application hosting ads and posts with CRUD capabilities (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using a CosmosDB database and azure functions in the back-end. From this serverless architecture, the functions are then containerized and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.

Implemented Azure ressources in the project:
- Cosmos DB
- FunctionApp
- Webapp
- EventHub
- LogicApp with SendGrid
- Azure Container Registry for Docker images
- Kubernetes deployment
